# Example of using the ```diff``` command

The ```diff``` command can be very useful to show just the differences
between two files.  Our last exercise provides a good example of its use.

    $ diff 03simulate_n.R 04simulate_l.R
    34,38c34,36
    < #  Loop over the sample sizes and estimate power for each
    < for (n in sample.sizes) {
    <     tmp.power <- t.power.sim(n=n, n.reps=1000, mean.2=2.5, sd.common=5.0)
    <     power.array <- c(power.array, tmp.power)
    < }
    ---
    > #  Use lapply the t.power.sim function for each value in sample.sizes
    > power.list <- lapply(sample.sizes, t.power.sim,
    >                      n.reps=1000, mean.1=0.0, mean.2=2.5, sd.common=5.0)
    41c39
    < power.dat <- data.frame(n=sample.sizes, power=power.array)
    ---
    > power.dat <- data.frame(n=sample.sizes, power=unlist(power.list))

The first line of output, ```34,38c34,36``` says that the first named file
has lines 34 to 38 where the second file has lines 34 to 36.  Lines in the
first named file are indicated with the ```<``` character, and lines from
the second named file are indicated with ```>```.

The second set of changes is indicated by another line range, this time
only a single line, 34 in the first file corresponds to 39 in the second.
Once you become accustomed to reading ```diff``` output, it can be used as
you work to check that changes you are making are all and only the changes
you intend.

It is conventional to name the older file or version first and the newer
second.

Many version control systems use ```diff```, or at least its output format
to display differences between versions, so being able to read ```diff```
output is also useful for that reason.
