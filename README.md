This repository contains example code used in a workshop on very basic
use of R for use on multiple processors or multiple nodes, basically
the functions ```mclapply()```, ```parLapply()```, and
```clusterApply()``` from the ```parallel()``` library.

Based on work originally done by David Childers and Bennet Fauber for a
workshop at the University of Michigan.  Material also contributed by
Missy Plegue of the Center for Statistical Consultation and Research,
also at the University of Michigan.
